  <div class="two"> <p><pre>Happiest birthday Mahi,</pre> First of all, let me wish you ur upcoming journey to be more fun, full of life and laughter. Finally, you are stepping out from adolescense and a step closer to your 20.</p>
   <p>Its been a decade since we became friends. Its a long journey, right.  From being friends to neighbour, we had a great ride. Spending lots of time together was and is always special. Let me recall all the special moments we had, the time we shared our loud laughs and all the good days we spent sitting on the last bench, always laughing and not concerntrating on our studies(well that was sth. which will forever remain in my memories). </p>
   <p>Bunking on saraswati pooja's decoration day and going out with that step-teacher, one of the most adventurous thing that we did along with almost getting suspended because of that non-living thing. Moreover, that khudai of the wall, you got a great scope in construction lol destruction. must say ;)
     </p>
     <p>I am always grateful to be friends with you. And all the good memories that I can recall, always have you guys in it.</p>
     <p>I think I was supposed to talk about you , but I drifted to other topics. You are a very amazing person(The main character), the life of the show. The personality and the aura that you hold is exceptional. You have a very strong personality, which I always admired. Moreover, the way you take stand for yourself and oppose things, thats truely sth that all will be envy of. Never lose your charm and continue being such a strong and pure soul. Good days are on your way, so don't lose hope. Worry less!!</p>
